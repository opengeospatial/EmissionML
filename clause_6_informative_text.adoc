== The Problem: Lacking Consistent Ontology and Fragmentation in Emissions Data
The advancement of sensing technologies, digital communications, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence now enables the measurement, monitoring, reporting, and verification (MMRV) of emissions at unprecedented scale and resolution. Satellites can quantify atmospheric pollutants from orbit, aircraft and drones provide high-resolution overflights, continuous monitoring systems deliver real-time data streams, and handheld instruments remain essential for targeted inspections. These innovations have raised expectations for transparency and rigor in emissions reporting across regulatory and voluntary programs. Yet the data ecosystem has not kept pace: without common models and standards, the value of these new technologies is often constrained by fragmentation, duplication, and costly integrations.

This fragmentation is evident across the entire emissions data lifecycle. Each technology vendor, operator, and reporting program tends to define its own vocabulary, formats, and assumptions. Data that should be straightforward to collect becomes difficult to integrate, trace, and compare. A remote sensing detection may not align with ground-level observations — for example, bottom-up inventories — when source features are described inconsistently. Regulators often require the same data to be restated in multiple incompatible templates. Operators face the added challenge of reconciling proprietary vendor outputs with internal enterprise systems, which further drives up cost and complexity. The consequence is predictable: high costs, duplicated effort, and delays in turning detection into actionable emissions reductions.

Emissions data now stands at a similar crossroads to the early days of digital mapping. Then, geospatial information was locked in proprietary systems, requiring costly, one-off conversions with little assurance of interoperability. The introduction of open OGC standards for features and web services changed everything: today billions of people use online maps on their phones, in vehicles, and across countless applications without ever thinking about the standards that make them work. The standards became invisible, yet indispensable. Emissions data needs the same foundation. Without a shared ontology and data model, stakeholders will continue to face high costs, fragmented workflows, and limited transparency. EmissionML provides that missing layer — a future-proof, standards-aligned ontology that addresses the root causes of fragmentation, ensures consistency and traceability, and unlocks a true “Web of Emissions Information” to support faster response, credible reporting, and more effective emissions reduction.

Summary — key challenges at a glance:

* High costs and duplicated effort from bespoke integrations across vendors and systems.
* Difficulties linking diverse measurements, such as remote sensing, ground in-situ observations, and inventories, due to inconsistent definitions.
* Incompatible reporting requirements across regulatory and voluntary programs, creating administrative burden and undermining comparability.

== What EmissionML Is — and What It’s Not

=== What EmissionML Is

If new sensing technologies are expanding what is technically measurable, EmissionML is about ensuring those sensor observations can be understood, trusted, and exchanged without friction and information loss. At its core, EmissionML is a shared ontology and data model for emission events and necessary relevant metadata in order to make the emission data useful. It provides a common language to describe sources, events, and observations, so that data collected by satellites, drones, continuous monitors, or facility reporting systems can be consistently interpreted and combined to estimate the duration, location, and magnitude of an emission event. In this way, EmissionML does not replace existing tools or dictate methods; instead, it enables them to work together, much as open geospatial standards allowed different mapping systems to interoperate seamlessly.

Specifically, EmissionML provides:

	* A semantic foundation for interoperable reporting across multiple frameworks.
	* A bridge between observations (sensor or estimate), source features (the equipment or site where emissions occur), and emission events (the occurrences themselves).
	* A flexible modeling language that can serve as an intermediary data model, enabling a “write once, use many times” approach for outputs across multiple reporting frameworks.
	* Data structures that are AI-ready, ensuring that automated reasoning and validation can be applied.
	* Alignment with OGC, ISO, and W3C standards, including Observations and Measurements (ISO 19156:2023) and the SOSA/SSN ontology.

=== What EmissionML Is Not

Equally important is clarifying what EmissionML does not attempt to be:

	* It is not a methane MMRV protocol such as OGMP 2.0, Veritas, or MiQ. Instead, it can represent the data that those frameworks require.
	* It is not a fixed reporting format like a CSV schema or PDF template. EmissionML underlies such formats but does not replace them.
	* It is not an AI or ML model. While designed to be AI-ready, EmissionML itself is a data standard, not an algorithm.
	* It is not a raw sensor data format. Vendors can continue to use proprietary payloads, but EmissionML provides the normalization layer.
	* It is not a standalone software package. Instead, it is an ontology that can be implemented in software.
	* It is not the only modeling language. EmissionML complements and builds upon SOSA, O&M, and related standards.

In short: EmissionML’s strength lies in being a neutral, extensible foundation that enables diverse protocols, frameworks, and tools to interoperate seamlessly—today and as new innovations emerge.

== Use Cases: Real-world EmissionML Applications

=== EmissionML Use Cases
To illustrate EmissionML’s potential, we present real-world applications where the lack of a common ontology creates friction today — and where a shared data model can deliver clear benefits for stakeholders, such as regulators, operators, vendors, researchers and investors.

=== What the world looks like with EmissionML
Imagine a world where emissions data flows as seamlessly as financial information or digital maps. A plume detected by satellite is automatically linked to a site, verified against ground-based monitors, and cross-checked with operational data — all within minutes. Regulators receive reports in a consistent, auditable format without manual re-entry. Operators diagnose and repair leaks in hours instead of weeks. Investors and insurers compare emissions performance across companies with the same confidence they place in audited financial statements. Researchers build upon shared datasets instead of recreating them. In such a future, EmissionML is invisible but indispensable: the common foundation that makes emissions information trustworthy, interoperable, and actionable at global scale.

== Adoption Pathways & Call to Action

Turning this vision into reality requires broad adoption. Just as OGC’s open standards unlocked the geospatial web, EmissionML will only deliver its full value through collective action. No single actor can overcome emissions data fragmentation alone. Regulators, operators, technology vendors, researchers, and investors all have a vital role to play in building a shared, standards-based foundation. The pathways below outline concrete steps that each community can take to accelerate adoption and unlock the benefits of a seamless “Web of Emissions Information.”
