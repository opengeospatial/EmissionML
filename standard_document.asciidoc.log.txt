[big]*iv.    Security Considerations*

//If no security considerations have been made for this Standard, use the following text.

No security considerations have been made for this Standard.

////
If security considerations have been made for this Standard, follow the examples found in IANA or IETF documents. Please see the following example.
“VRRP is designed for a range of internetworking environments that may employ different security policies. The protocol includes several authentication methods ranging from no authentication, simple clear text passwords, and strong authentication using IP Authentication with MD5 HMAC. The details on each approach including possible attacks and recommended environments follows.
Independent of any authentication type VRRP includes a mechanism (setting TTL=255, checking on receipt) that protects against VRRP packets being injected from another remote network. This limits most vulnerabilities to local attacks.
NOTE: The security measures discussed in the following sections only provide various kinds of authentication. No confidentiality is provided at all. This should be explicitly described as outside the scope....”

== Terms and Definitions
This document uses the terms defined in link:++https://portal.ogc.org/public_ogc/directives/directives.php++[OGC Policy Directive 49], which is based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, Rules for the structure and drafting of International Standards. In particular, the word “shall” (not “must”) is the verb form used to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this Standard and OGC documents do not use the equivalent phrases in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.

This document also uses terms defined in the OGC Standard for Modular specifications (link:++https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=34762++[OGC 08-131r3]), also known as the 'ModSpec'. The definitions of terms such as standard, specification, requirement, and conformance test are provided in the ModSpec.

For the purposes of this document, the following additional terms and definitions apply.

Emission Event::
An Emission Event is an occurrent representing the release of a substance into the atmosphere over a non-zero duration. It is characterized by its start time and end time, the Source Feature from which the substance originated, and the identity and quantity of the emitted substance.

Feature::
Abstraction of real world phenomena (Source: ISO 19101-1:2014)

Measurement::
Set of operations having the object of determining the value of a quantity (Source: link:++https://docs.ogc.org/as/20-082r4/20-082r4.html++[ISO/OGC 19156:2023])

Mechanism::
A Mechanism is a classification of the specific physical, chemical, or operational process that constitutes the direct cause or pathway for an emission. It is a member of a controlled vocabulary and is defined independently of the Source Feature — including its identity, structure, or purpose — allowing Mechanisms to be consistently reused across different types of Source Features.

Observation::
Act carried out by an observer to determine the value of an observable property of an object (feature-of-interest) by using a procedure, with the value provided as the result (Source: link:++https://docs.ogc.org/as/20-082r4/20-082r4.html++[ISO/OGC 19156:2023])

Source Feature::
A Source Feature is an ISO 19101 feature whose geometry provides the geospatial reference for one or more Emission Events. A Source Feature is characterised solely by its own identity, geometry, intended function, and lifecycle; it is explicitly agnostic to the Mechanism by which any associated Emission Event occur.

Unit of Measure::
Reference quantity chosen from a unit equivalence group (Source: link:++https://docs.ogc.org/as/20-082r4/20-082r4.html++[ISO/OGC 19156:2023])
