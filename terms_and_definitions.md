## Terms and definitions

### Emissions

The release of a substance (usually a gas when referring to the subject of climate change) into the atmosphere. Source: [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/glossary#E) *Note: this definition seems to be more suitable for our scope.*

[2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories](https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/0_Overview/V0_2_Glossary.pdf) defines emissions as the release of greenhouse gases and/or their precursors into the atmosphere over a specified area and period of time. (UNFCCC Article 1.4) *Note: this definition limits its scope to GHG and our scope is wider than GHG emissions.*

EEA defines air emission as discharge of pollutants into the atmosphere from stationary sources such as smokestacks, and other vents, and from surface areas of commercial or industrial facilities and mobile sources, for example, motor vehicles, locomotives and aircrafts.

### Emission Event


### Emission Inventory

EPA defines **[a greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory](https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/scopes-1-2-and-3-emissions-inventorying-and-guidance)** is a list of emission sources and the associated emissions quantified using standardized methods. Organizations develop GHG inventories for a variety of reasons, including: Managing GHG risks and identifying reduction opportunities; Participating in voluntary or mandatory GHG programs; Participating in GHG market; Achieving recognition for early voluntary action.

EEA defines **[emission inventory](https://www.eea.europa.eu/help/glossary/eea-glossary/emission-inventory)** as a listing, by source, of the amount of air pollutants discharged into the atmosphere of a community.

Veritas defines **[Emissions Inventory](https://veritas.gti.energy/protocols)**: A record of all known sources of emissions and the emission rates from those sources. An inventory provides an estimation of emissions over a given period of time.

Veritas further defines **[Bottom-up Inventory](https://veritas.gti.energy/protocols)**: Method based on engineering calculations, manufacturer data, and emissions factors for emissions sources/activities and corresponding activity factors. Emission calculations and factors sometimes including individual source measurements, compiled to develop an account of emissions discharged to the atmosphere from an asset (e.g., compressor station) or a geographic area (e.g., basin, state, region). 

### Emission Factors

### Feature
abstraction of real world phenomena (Source: ISO 19101-1:2014)

*Note: More details about the term 'feature' may be found in the [W3C/OGC Spatial Data on the Web Best Practice](https://docs.ogc.org/is/17-069r4/17-069r4.html#SDWBP) in the section '[Spatial Things, Features and Geometry](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/#spatial-things-features-and-geometry)'.*

### Measurement
set of operations having the object of determining the value of a quantity (Source: [ISO/OGC 19156:2023](https://docs.ogc.org/as/20-082r4/20-082r4.html#_3_12_measurement))

### Observation
act carried out by an observer to determine the value of an observable property of an object (feature-of-interest) by using a procedure, with the value provided as the result  (Source: [ISO/OGC 19156:2023](https://docs.ogc.org/as/20-082r4/20-082r4.html#_3_13_observation))

### Reconciliation

### Unit of Measure
reference quantity chosen from a unit equivalence group (Source: [ISO/OGC 19156:2023](https://docs.ogc.org/as/20-082r4/20-082r4.html#_3_26_unit_of_measure)
