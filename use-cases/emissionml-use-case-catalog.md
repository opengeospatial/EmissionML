| ID / Title | Primary Stakeholder(s) | Pain Point | EmissionML-Enabled Solution | Key Benefit(s) |
|------------|------------------------|------------|-----------------------------|----------------|
| **UC-1 / Regulatory e-Reporting Pipeline** | Operators; Regulators | Multiple bespoke templates; manual report preparation; software vendor-lock in  | Emit once in EmissionML → auto-transform to EPA, ECCC, EU, OGMP, MiQ schemas | “Single-source” reporting; lower compliance cost |
| **UC-2 / Cross-Vendor Sensor Fusion** | Sensor vendors; Platform integrators | Proprietary payloads block plug-and-play analytics | Streamline all sensor events as EmissionML Observation --> EmissionEvent | Vendor-agnostic analytics/dashboards; faster onboarding |
| **UC-3 / LDAR Prioritisation** | LDAR services | Heterogeneous site data and metadata prevent analytics/AI to establish site risk profiles | Train & run models on corpus tagged with EmissionML SourceFeature & Mechanism | Sharper leak-risk ranking; fewer truck rolls |
| **UC-4 / Satellite-to-Ground (super-emitter) Validation** | Satellite providers; Regulators | Hard to match plume detections with field data | Use EmissionML SourceFeature & Observations to link plumes to ground events | Credible and explainable validation chain; boosts trust |
| **UC-5 / Corporate ESG Consolidation** | Multi-jurisdiction operators | Subsidiaries report in incompatible formats | Subsidiaries export EmissionML; HQ aggregates automatically | Near-real-time portfolio GHG view; audit-ready trail |
| **UC-6 / Real-Time Incident Alerts** | Control rooms | Event management and handling differ across SCADA, OGI, camera, CMS feeds | Merge observation-events into EmissionML Events, and publish events in an EmissionML broker → unified alert bus | Faster root-cause triage; consistent nomenclature |
| **UC-7 / Carbon-Market Quantification** | Project developers; Offset registries | Methodologies demand transparent calculations | Store quant & quality fields in EmissionML → reproducible MRV | Higher credit integrity; lower verification spend |
| **UC-8 / Research Benchmark Datasets** | Academics; NGOs | Ad-hoc CSVs lack semantics | Publish curated datasets in EmissionML | Comparable studies; traceable quantification and uncertainties; accelerates method innovation |
| **UC-9 / SME Plug-and-Play Portal** | Small/medium operators; SaaS vendors | Limited IT resources; manual compliance | Web portal auto-maps spreadsheets/SCADA exports to EmissionML & generates filings | Low-friction adoption; compliance at minimal cost |
| **UC-10 / Digital-Twin Emission or LDAR Simulation** | Engineering firms; Operators | No consistent data model for emission event simulation; no cross-simulator data sharing | Using EmissionML events as the data interoperability among simulators | Simulation result validation and comparison; repeatable and comparable simulation results|
| **UC-11 / Chain-of-Custody & Audit Log** | Operators; Auditors; Cyber-security teams | Data tampering / provenance doubts | Digitally sign & hash EmissionML records; record on tamper-evident ledger | Legal defensibility; trustworthy audit trail |
| **UC-12 / Community Transparency Dashboard** | Communities; NGOs; Operators | Low public trust due to opaque data | Public map dashboard fed by EmissionML from multiple sources | Builds social trust; meets disclosure mandates |
| **UC-13 / Financial-Risk Stress-Test** | Banks; Investors; ESG analysts | Methane risk not priced into lending decisions | Ingest EmissionML history & projections into credit-risk models | Data-driven lending rates; capital rewards for proactive operators |
