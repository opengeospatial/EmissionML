.Preface
This Discussion Paper addresses the urgent need for interoperability in emissions data by examining how a shared modeling approach can reduce fragmentation and build trust across regulatory, voluntary, and market-driven frameworks. The paper does not attempt to describe the full technical content of EmissionML — that material is available on the https://github.com/opengeospatial/EmissionML[EmissionML GitHub] — but instead frames the problem of inconsistent vocabularies and incompatible reporting templates, illustrates the benefits of a common foundation through real-world use cases, and identifies adoption pathways for diverse stakeholders.

The purpose of this document is to engage the broader community of regulators, operators, technology providers, researchers, and investors in a discussion on the feasibility and value of harmonizing emissions data. Like many successful OGC efforts, the goal is not to prescribe specific technologies, but to provide a neutral, extensible foundation that enables interoperability across existing and emerging systems.

This work builds on the history of OGC standards, including the Sensor Web Enablement suite, the OGC/ISO Observations and Measurements (O&M) model, and the SOSA/SSN ontology developed in collaboration with W3C. These efforts demonstrated the power of shared information models for environmental and geospatial data. EmissionML extends this lineage by applying the same principles to emissions information, leveraging lessons from geospatial interoperability to address urgent climate and ESG challenges.

Future work will include refinement of the EmissionML conceptual model through open-source software implementations, closer alignment with related OGC and ISO standards, and exploration of applicability beyond emissions to other ESG domains such as wastewater, carbon capture and storage, and nitrogen-use efficiency. Community feedback on this Discussion Paper will guide next steps toward a candidate OGC standard and potential joint standardization with ISO.

*ISO Declaration*

ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.

International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.

The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.

== Abstract

Recent advances in sensing, communications, cloud computing, and AI now make it possible to measure, monitor, report, and verify emissions at unprecedented scale. Satellites, aircraft, continuous monitors, and field instruments provide rich data streams, yet the value of these innovations is limited by fragmentation. Inconsistent vocabularies, incompatible reporting formats, and costly bespoke integrations create duplication, delay, and uncertainty.

This Discussion Paper highlights the interoperability challenge and outlines how a shared modeling approach can address it. With common ontologies and data models, emissions data can flow seamlessly across technologies and jurisdictions. Regulators can automate audits, operators can cut reporting costs and accelerate detection-to-repair, vendors can deliver plug-and-play solutions, and investors can gain confidence in transparent, comparable disclosures.

While focused on emissions, the principles extend across ESG domains such as wastewater management, carbon capture and storage, and nitrogen-use efficiency.

== Security Considerations

//If no security considerations have been made for this Standard, use the following text.

No security considerations have been made for this Standard.

////
If security considerations have been made for this Standard, follow the examples found in IANA or IETF documents. Please see the following example.

“VRRP is designed for a range of internetworking environments that may employ different security policies. The protocol includes several authentication methods ranging from no authentication, simple clear text passwords, and strong authentication using IP Authentication with MD5 HMAC. The details on each approach including possible attacks and recommended environments follows.

Independent of any authentication type VRRP includes a mechanism (setting TTL=255, checking on receipt) that protects against VRRP packets being injected from another remote network. This limits most vulnerabilities to local attacks.
NOTE: The security measures discussed in the following sections only provide various kinds of authentication. No confidentiality is provided at all. This should be explicitly described as outside the scope....”
