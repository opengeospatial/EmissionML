- Discussions
  - Discussion Paper outline
  - task: add a value chain of emissions data, and where does EmissionML fits
  - Zach started a discussion regarding release liquid (as a type of substance) to a different medium (such as water) in scope of EmissionML. Current model seems work. If we are changing scope, need to interview experts in the domain (e.g., pipeline leaking?)
  - Josh mentioned about cross border trade can be a use case as well.
  - EmissionML can be a model for environmental attribute of commodity.
  - One disuccsion about the barriers for adoption. Why should stakeholders adopt EmissionML? Cost and benefits?
