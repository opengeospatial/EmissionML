## Decisions/Actions
- reviewed and improved the use cases, and approved all use cases in the catalog.
  - auditing is an important theme for most use cases
  - Ryan reminded the danger of developing a standard based on "edge-cases". It might make the standard development process lengthy and not user friendly.
  - new use cases can be proposed by creating new GitHub issues
- didn't have time to discuss issue #4~9. can be discussed offline on GitHub
- next meeting is in two weeks
