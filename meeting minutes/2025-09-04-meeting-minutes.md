  -  Zara/Ryan: readers might not know it's FREE to use the standard and the open source tools.  Call it out.
  -  Erin: why the use case list is shorter than the Github.  Steve: want to make it short.  What we can do is to have link to the complete use case table on Github.
  -  Sara: we should have a TLDR (executive summary) Ryan: maybe even just bullet points
  -  Zara: discuss how it complements with existing standards.... a figure maybe?
  -  Ryan: Agora has some comments regarding how EmissionML could/should interact with other OGC standards. Re: Chris and Rob comments.
